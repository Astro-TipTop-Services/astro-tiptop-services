In this contribution we study the feasibility of using such tool for nowcast application (present-time forecast), such as the characterization of an on-sky measured PSF in real observations. Specifically we will analyze the performance of the simulation software in characterizing the real-time PSF of two different state-of-the-art SCAO adaptive optics instruments: SOUL at the LBT, and SAXO at the VLT.

Our main goal in this phase is to quantify the level of uncertainly of the AO simulations in reproducing real on-sky observed PSFs with an end-to-end code (PASSATA). In a successive phase we intend to use a faster analytical code (TIPTOP).

The intricate nature of AO-corrected PSFs necessitated the development of advanced analytical models capable of efficiently capturing their intricate morphology. In this work, we utilize the TIPTOP PSF model to predict on-axis PSFs produced by the SPHERE instrument of ESOs UT3. TIPTOP accepts integrated (reduced) telemetry as input. In theory, the physics-based analytical nature of TIPTOP should result in precise PSF predictions when using reduced telemetry as inputs to the PSF model. However, our research underscores a divergence from this expectation. By utilizing real on-sky datasets recorded on SPHERE, we demonstrate that the calibration of these analytical models is essential for improved prediction accuracy. This work introduces an approach to calibrating PSF models by conjoining them with a feed-forward Neural Network (NN). Furthermore, we present two methodologies to approach its training. Our findings reveal that the calibrated PSF model can achieve a prediction error of 13.6% on real on-sky datasets, while on simulated data, PSF prediction error can be further reduced to only 1.7%.

Here we report one of the last improvements of TIPTOP: the introduction of the error given by a single conjugated laser, commonly known as the cone effect. The Cone effect was not introduced before because it is challenging due to the non-stationarity of the phase. Laser guide stars are at a finite distance with respect to the telescope and probe beam accepted by the wavefront sensor has the shape of a cone. Given a single spatial frequency in an atmospheric layer, the cone effect arises from the apparent magnification or stretching of this frequency when it reaches the wavefront sensor. The magnification effect leads to an incorrect estimation of the spatial frequency. Therefore, we estimate the residual power by calculating the difference between two sinusoids with different periods: the nominal one and the magnified one. Replicating this for each spatial frequency we obtain the power spectrum associated with the cone effect. We compare this estimation with the one given by end-to-end simulation and we present how we plan to validate this with on-sky data."]})]}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{style:{marginBottom:"1.5rem"},children:[(0,s.jsx)("h3",{style:{marginBottom:"0.5rem"},children:(0,s.jsx)("a",{href:"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.08563",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:'[5] "Simplified model(s) of the GRAVITY+ adaptive optics system(s) for performance prediction"'})}),(0,s.jsxs)("p",{align:"justify",children:[(0,s.jsx)("strong",{children:" Berdeu, A., Le Bouquin, J.-B., Mella, G., Bourg\xe8s, L., Berger, J.-P.

They provide the unique opportunity to put constraints on the first phase of mass assembly in the Universe with the ease of being nearby. While only a few relics have been found in the local Universe, the INSPIRE project has confirmed 38 relics at higher redshifts (z ~ 0.2-0.4), fully characterising their integrated kinematics and stellar populations. However, given the very small sizes of these objects and the limitations imposed by the atmosphere, structural parameters inferred from ground-based optical imaging are possibly affected by systematic effects that are difficult to quantify.
