On January 26, 2026, the TipTop team was delighted to take part in a dedicated TipTop Meeting held at ESO Headquarters in Garching.

This meeting was a great opportunity to bring together developers and ESO stakeholders to discuss the current status of TipTop, its ongoing integration into ESO tools for observation preparation, and the exciting perspectives for future use, including upcoming instruments and the ELT. We also had fruitful discussions on possible improvements and new use cases for the tool.
