[TipTop v1.3.33](https://github.com/astro-tiptop/TIPTOP/releases/tag/v1.3.32), [P3 v1.4.13](https://github.com/astro-tiptop/P3/releases/tag/v1.4.13) are here! 🎉  

This release improves memory usage in P3, especially in the aliasing PSD computation that previously dominated memory in large simulations.

✨ What’s new

- Improved memory management in the `p3.ao.fourierModel` module: more intermediate variables are now released via the `reduce_memory` option (enabled by default in TipTop).

- Reworked aliasing PSD computation with more memory-efficient array handling.

👉 Heavy TipTop/P3 cases that previously required large amounts of RAM should now run more easily and reliably.

Update now and enjoy the latest enhancements 🚀
