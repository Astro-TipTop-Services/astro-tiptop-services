# TipTop Installation Tutorial

**TipTop** was designed from the ground up to be easily installed and used.

## Getting Started

Get started by **installing TipTop**. Follow these simple steps to get up and running quickly.

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->

### What you'll need

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

   - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.11 or higher)

We recommend using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for managing your environment.

## Step 1: (Recommended) Creating a virtual environment

### Using conda

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new conda environment named tiptop with Python 3.11 or higher by running the following command:
```bash
conda create --name tiptop python=3.11
```

3. Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate tiptop
```

### Using venv - Python

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
2. Create a new virtual environment named tiptop:

```bash
python -m venv tiptop
```
or
```bash
python3 -m venv tiptop
```
3. Activate your virtual environment:
```bash
# Unix
source ./tiptop/bin/activate
```
or
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\tiptop\Scripts\activate
```
**Note**: We only support Python >= 3.11.

## Step 2: (Optional) Install GPU Support

If you have a GPU and want to take advantage of hardware acceleration: install [CuPy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html).\
Run this command to install CuPy in your conda environment:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cupy
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

All other dependencies should be installed automatically, whether you choose to install **TipTop** via pip or by downloading the repository directly (see next step).

If you need a more sophisticated user interface than a command prompt, you can use any IDE that supports iPython or the Python command prompt. Here are some IDEs the team has tested:

  - Jupyter and JupyterLab (many files are Jupyter Notebooks):

  Install Jupyter and JupyterLab:
```bash
conda install jupyter
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
If you donâ€™t wish to use the provided Jupyter Notebooks, you can convert them using the jupyter library:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to python targetNotebook.ipynb
```

- Spyder (another popular option):
```bash
conda install spyder
```

- Vs Code:
To use VS Code, simply install the Python extension for VS Code, which supports iPython and the Python command prompt.\

## Step 4: Install TipTop

After the environment is set up and activated, there are two main ways to install **TipTop**:

### Install from PyPi
To install the latest release of [**TipTop**](https://pypi.org/project/astro-tiptop/) with its dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install astro-tiptop
```

### Install from Git Repository
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/astro-tiptop/TIPTOP.git
```
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned TipTop and install it (remove --user to install for all users):
```bash
pip install -e --user .
```

## Step 5: (Optionnal) Development Setup
If you plan to do your own development or fix bugs, you will need to download and install the following libraries:
- [MASTSEL] https://github.com/astro-tiptop/MASTSEL
- [SYMAO] https://github.com/astro-tiptop/SYMAO
- [SEEING] https://github.com/astro-tiptop/SEEING
- [P3] https://github.com/astro-tiptop/P3/

## Now you're ready to explore TipTop!
