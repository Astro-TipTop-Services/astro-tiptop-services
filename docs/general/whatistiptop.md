The **TipTop** tool takes its roots in an analytical approach, where the simulations are done in the Fourier domain. This allows to reach a very fast computation time (few seconds per PSF with GPU acceleration), and efficiently explore the wide parameter space.\ TipTop has been developed in Python, taking advantage of previous work developed in different languages, and unifying them in a single framework.
