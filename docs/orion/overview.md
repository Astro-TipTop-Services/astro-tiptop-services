The **TipTop** tool takes its roots in an analytical approach, where the simulations are done in the Fourier domain. This allows to reach a very fast computation time (few seconds per PSF with GPU acceleration), and efficiently explore the wide parameter space. /
TIPTOP has been developed in Python, taking advantage of previous work developed in different languages, and unifying them in a single framework.
